- I was able to get about 10,000 points a day using this bot
- Got the "Contributor", "Epic" and "Best Post of the Day" trophies.
- I managed to unlock all of Imgur's medallions
- 500 points an hour average
- At least one post a day makes it to most viral
- For a setup guide, see [here](https://mr-steal-your-script.github.io/ImgurBot.html?)
- I reccommend occasionally checking the bot's posts, as it occasionally posts things that are against Imgur's ToS.
